# Shaurya Gupta

![Moi](static/me.jpg){#avatar .ui .right .floated .small .image .bordered}
Welcome to my homepage! I am __Shaurya Gupta__, a software engineer from India who is passionate about __Haskell__, __programming languages__ and __compilers__!

I take notes in Zettelkasten style using [Neuron][1] which is also used to generate this website.

## Bio

I am a SWE working in the Compiler Release Tooling team at __Google Munich__. I was previously a Haskell consultant at Juspay and before that I was an intern at Google and D.E. Shaw. I received my B.Tech. in CSE from Indian Institute of Technology Patna.
I have worked on language servers for [C++][11] and [Haskell][12], a [json schema language][10] and a propietary PureScript to Haskell transpiler.

In a previous life, I did [[cp]] and went to the [ICPC World Finals][13] twice.

My [dev setup][17] is Arch Linux with XMonad, XMobar and Kitty. I'm in the process of transitioning to NixOS.

Although I am not a very artsy person, I like to think I have a good taste (thanks to Hiro!) in films([Letterboxd][2]) and music([Last.fm][6], [Spotify][4]) and would love to exchange recommendations.

My name is pronounced as **shor**_t_ + **ya**. I go by the online alias _SureYeaah_ which sounds similar to my name.
