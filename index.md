# Veenit Kumar

![Moi](static/me.jpg)

Welcome to my homepage! I am __Veenit Kumar__, a upcoming software engineer from India who is passionate about __C++__, __Competitive Programming__ and __Open Source__!

I take notes in Zettelkasten style using [Neuron][1] which is also used to generate this website.

## Bio

I am a Student Developer working in the pgRouting under [OSGeo][18] at __Google Summer of Code__. I am doing my B.Tech. in CSE from Netaji Subhash Engineering College Kolkata.
I have worked on language servers for [C++][11] and [Boost Graph Library][20].

In a previous life, I did __CP__.

My dev setup is Ubuntu 21.04. I'm in the process of transitioning to MacOS.

Although I am not a very artsy person, I like to think I have a good taste (thanks to Levi!) in films ([Letterboxd][2]) and music ([Last.fm][6], [Spotify][4]) and would love to exchange recommendations.

My name is pronounced as **Vee** _v_ + **nit**. I go by the online alias _veenits123_.
