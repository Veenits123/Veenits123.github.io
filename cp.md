# Competitive Programming


I did a lot of competitive programming mostly in the first two years of my bachelors.

I followed the book [Competitive Programming 3][2] and am eternally grateful to Felix Halim and Steven Halim for this gem.
I mostly practiced on [SPOJ][6] and used C++ as my primary language. I also used [HackerRank (HackerRank)][3], [Codeforces][4] and [Codechef][5].

These days I solve problems occasionally to get better at C++ and on my todo list is getting more people to do Competitive Programming in C++.
Contact me if this is something you would like to collaborate on.

I also maintain an almost exhaustive repositories [here][1]. The repos has around **50K LoC**!
